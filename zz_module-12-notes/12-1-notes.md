# Lesson 12.1

## 12.1.2 Preview

Which of the following gameplans do you think is the best way to tackle this lesson?

_We need to create the MySQL database and set up the candidates table before we can create the schema and seed files. This will allow us to determine the structure of the database and table before we create the files that will pre-populate the database with data we can use to test the application._

| Step # | Module # | Task                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | 12.1.3   | Set up the project files.                 | We'll start by creating a GitHub repository and setting up the folder structure.                                                                           |
| 2      | 12.1.4   | Create the database and candidates table. | We’ll connect to MySQL and create the first database. We’ll then add a table to the database to hold the data for the candidates.                          |
| 3      | 12.1.5   | Populate candidates table with data.      | The next step is to add data about the candidates to the table.                                                                                            |
| 3      | 12.1.6   | Save queries in schema and seed files.    | Create schema and seed files so that other developers can automatically create the database structure and pre-populate it with data from the command line. |
